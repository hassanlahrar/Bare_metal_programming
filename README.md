# Bare_metal_programming - CMSIS and FreeRTOS

As I am interested in embedded systems and embedded software programming. I put here some examples of my own mini-projects aiming at the Nucleo-STM32F103RB board. I use bare-metal programming as an approach, playing especially with peripherals regiters , it allows to understand deeply the functioning of the peripherals. In addition I used FreeRTOS as a Kernel, to manage several tasks at the same time.
You can find templates of FreeRTOS and CMSIS registers, without any IDE used (just need a text editor and terminal).  
To flash your program in the board, you can use OpenOCD directly or add it in CMake file (ther is an exemple in some files). For debuging use 'gdb'.
